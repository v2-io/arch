# FORMAT.md — Segment File Conventions

How to write and maintain AAT claim segment files.

> **No-drift discipline.** Key process terms used throughout this file are cross-linked to entries in [`terminology/entries/`](../../terminology/entries/). If a term's meaning changes, update both FORMAT.md and the corresponding terminology entry — they must stay in sync. Format conventions live here; concise definitions and the canonical prose vocabulary live in the entries (and are auto-rendered into [`LEXICON.md`](../../LEXICON.md)).


## Audiences and Render Targets

Every convention in this document is a trade-off across six consumer-purpose-format-platform combinations. Naming them up front prevents the trade-offs from getting re-decided per-section.

| Consumer | Purpose                                            | Format/Form   | Platform                                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Human    | Authoring & Editing                                | Sources       | Obsidian                                       |
| Agent    | Authoring & Editing                                | Sources       | Raw                                            |
| Human    | Investigating & Contributing                       | Sources       | Github                                         |
| Agent    | Investigating, Using, Understanding                | Intermediates | Raw                                            |
| Human    | Formal Reviewing, Archiving, Citing, Understanding | Finals        | PDF Viewer                                     |
| Agent    | Formal Reviewing, Archiving, Citing                | Finals        | `pdftotext -layout -clip` and `pdftotext -raw` |

**Three formats:**

- **Sources** — tracking files, misc markdown artifacts, outlines, and (especially) per-segment markdown files in `<component>/src/`. Authoring substrate; lives under git; rendered live by Obsidian and on GitHub.
- **Intermediates** — assembled per-volume markdown at `mono/<slug>-v<sem>.md`. Build-output; canonical citable artifact; what an agent ingests when reasoning about a whole volume; cross-references resolved at this stage.
- **Finals** — `mono/<slug>-v<sem>.pdf`. Build-output; the publication artifact; what reviewers and archivists consume.

The source form is the most-constrained: it must satisfy four audiences (human + agent authoring, human + agent investigating) across three platforms (Obsidian, GitHub, raw text) simultaneously. Conventions are evaluated against all four cells, not just one. Intermediates and finals are build-managed — authors write source; the pipeline produces both. Conventions for intermediate / final rendering live downstream and are usually a matter of how the renderer chooses to resolve a source convention.


## Equation Render Constraints

Both display and inline equations must render correctly in three platforms (two source-side, one final):

- **GitHub source view** (MathJax): strict — see *Math Formatting* §Compatibility Notes below.
- **Obsidian source view** (MathJax variant): more permissive than GitHub but with its own quirks (same section).
- **LaTeX / PDF final** (LuaLaTeX + STIX Two Math): authoritative; raw LaTeX passes through.

The render-platform constraint generates the careful conventions in *Math Formatting* below (no spaces inside `$..$`, `\vert` for pipes, `\lt`/`\gt` for inequalities, `\ast` for asterisks, etc.) — these are not stylistic preferences; they are the dimensions in which Obsidian and GitHub disagree with each other and with LaTeX.

A display equation may carry up to seven distinct attributes, each independent in principle. Common case: an equation carries 0–2 of these (typically just an epistemic strength label). Rich case (appendix derivations, recapitulations of external results): 4+ attributes simultaneously. The eq-tag syntax has to handle both cases without forcing rich-case authors into a separate syntax tree.

| Attribute | Cardinality | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Reference number** | 0–1 | Auto from kaobook native counter, evergreen — source carries no number |
| **Epistemic strength label** | 0–1 | `*[Derived]*` / `*[Hypothesis]*` etc. — distinguishes derived / chosen / assumed |
| **Epistemic note** | 0–N (usually 0–1) | "from #foo, conditional on bar" — scope conditions and dependency context |
| **Reference tag** | 0–1 | Kebab-case identifier for evergreen `#name` cross-refs (independent of positional number) |
| **English / prose name** | 0–1 (plus informal aliases) | Human-readable name styled distinctly at final render |
| **External provenance / citation** | 0–N (usually 0–1) | Bibliographic citation for imported / recapitulated content |
| **Internal provenance / cross-reference** | 0–N (usually 0–1, rarely 2+) | `#slug` for segment-level link, atom-level link for intra-volume reference |

The current eq-tag syntax `*[Type (name, from ...)]*` compresses the first four attributes positionally. Citation and cross-reference attributes currently live in the surrounding prose. The full syntax for handling all seven attributes uniformly is under design — see [FORMAT-TODO.md](../../FORMAT-TODO.md) Workstream B.

Inline equations carry the same render-platform constraint but do not carry eq-tag attributes (the margin-note infrastructure that emits `\eqtag{...}` operates on the equation immediately following the tag paragraph, which is a display-equation pattern).


## Reference Kinds

ASF segments carry several kinds of references: internal cross-references between segments and named atoms, cross-volume references between sibling Volumes, external citations to published and pre-publication work, self-citations between ASF and its own derived publications, and content annotations (footnotes / sidenotes / margin-notes) that aren't references per se but sit in the same family. Each kind has its own *identity* (what the reference targets), *scope* (where it can reach), and rendering across the source / intermediate / final formats from *Audiences and Render Targets* above.

**Source-form is target-agnostic.** The same `\cite{key}` or `#slug-name` in source renders differently in scrbook vs kaobook vs future paper-format targets, but the source convention itself is the same. What a source form *resolves to* in each render target is target-specific implementation; current renderings, gaps, and trade-offs live in [FORMAT-TODO](../../FORMAT-TODO.md) Workstreams A and B.

**Many cells below are currently planned rather than working.** Source-form conventions like `#slug-name` exist in segments today but don't always navigate (e.g., Obsidian segment-slug navigation is currently non-functional even though the convention has been in place). The taxonomy below is foundational; the platform-by-platform render reality is implementation-tracked in FORMAT-TODO.

| Kind | Identity / Target | Scope | Source form | Final form |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Segment-level cross-reference** | segment slug | intra-volume | `#slug-name` (prose) or `[#slug-name](slug-name.md)` (linkable) | `\cref{seg:slug}` — e.g., "Definition 1.4" |
| **Atom-level cross-reference** | atom name (kebab-case) | intra-volume | `*[Type (name, …)]*` defines; `[[#^name]]` cites *(planned)* | `\cref{atom:name}` or `\eqref{name}` — e.g., "(1.4.2)" |
| **Cross-volume reference** | `volume:slug` or `volume:atom-name` | cross-volume | source form *(TBD — currently inline prose)* | `xr-hyper` resolved when sibling `.aux` available; bibliography-form fallback when not |
| **External published citation** | bibkey in `~/src/relata/` | external | `\citep{key}` / `\citet{key}` / `\citealt{key}` / `\citeauthor{key}` / `\citeyear{key}` | target-specific biblatex rendering with a printed bibliography |
| **External in-review / preprint citation** | bibkey + citation-status field | external (status-gated) | same `\cite{key}` — status lives in the relata entry, not in source | full citation if published/preprint; soft "in preparation" or local-source pointer if in-review and current build is anonymized |
| **Self-citation (cross-project)** | bibkey + self-flag | external + anonymization-gated | same `\cite{key}` — gating by build target | full citation in normal builds; suppressed or rephrased third-person in anonymized builds |
| **Footnote** | n/a — content placement | intra-segment | `[^anchor]` markdown or `\footnote{…}` raw-TeX | `\footnote{…}` numbered at page bottom |
| **Sidenote** *(numbered Tufte-style margin annotation)* | n/a — content placement | intra-segment | source form *(TBD)* | `\sidenote{…}` numbered margin annotation, with in-line callout number |
| **Margin-note** *(un-numbered, just-in-margin)* | n/a — content placement | intra-segment | currently auto-emitted from eq-tag paragraphs only; author-driven form *(TBD)* | `\marginnote{…}` un-numbered margin annotation |

**Scope vocabulary** (used in the table and elsewhere):

- **intra-segment** — the reference, annotation, or content-placement targets a location inside the same segment. Footnotes / sidenotes / margin-notes operate here.
- **intra-volume** — the reference targets a location inside the same Volume. Segment-level and atom-level cross-references operate here today.
- **cross-volume** — the reference targets a location in a sibling Volume (AAT ↔ TST ↔ LogA ↔ ELI). Resolution depends on sibling-volume `.aux` availability; fallback rendering ensures stand-alone reading still works.
- **external** — the reference targets work outside ASF. Bibliography database is the source of truth; build-managed snapshots inside the ASF repo keep ASF self-contained for readers without access to the shared database. Self-citations and in-review citations are special cases of external citation with anonymization / status gating.

**Citation discipline (decided 2026-06-05).** ASF uses a strengthened hybrid discipline. Rich scholarly prose remains allowed, but every bibliography-worthy scholarly source should have a formal natbib-compatible cite command in source, and every load-bearing external dependency should have a locator-backed formal cite where available. Use `\citep{key}` for parenthetical citations, `\citet{key}` for textual citations, `\citealt{key}` where the author-year/numeric form needs to sit inside richer prose, and `\citeauthor{key}` / `\citeyear{key}` only when the prose truly needs the pieces separately. Do not use biblatex-native `\textcite{...}` in ASF sources unless the relata scanner is extended; the current scanner is keyed to `\cite...` / natbib-style commands. Context-setting prose may remain prose-rich, but prose alone does not put a source in the bibliography.

**Load-bearing external dependencies.** Imported definitions, inherited theorem statements, recapitulated machinery, empirical claims, and prior-art assertions that support segment correctness need formal cites with page / chapter / theorem / section locators where available, then `claim-supported` / `page-ref` verification events in relata as promotion work proceeds. Internal `ref/` reports, Undermind catalogs, and local synthesis notes can remain Working-Notes provenance or search trails, but they are not source-of-truth citations for canon body claims.

**Build-managed snapshots — the self-containment principle.** External citations resolve through a build-managed snapshot mechanism: the bibliography database lives at `~/src/relata/` for cross-project sharing, but each volume's build extracts the entries the rendered volume actually cites into `mono/<slug>-v<sem>.references.bib`, and the snapshot is committed. `bin/build-monograph` emits this by scanning the Stage 2 assembled markdown rather than the raw component `src/` tree, so orphaned or non-rendered segment files do not leak into the bibliography. ASF stays self-contained — a future reader can read any volume without access to the shared database. The snapshot is build-managed (regenerated whenever cited entries change); authors never hand-edit it.

**Intermediate form — uniform resolution.** The intermediate format (the assembled per-volume markdown at `mono/<slug>-v<sem>.md` consumed by agent investigators) resolves all cross-references and external citations to their inline rendered form aggressively, so an agent reading the assembled markdown sees fully-resolved links and citations rather than unresolved markers. Implementation specifics (which kinds resolve at which stage, what the rendered inline form looks like) live in FORMAT-TODO.

**Imported external machinery with internal recapitulation — convention.** When AAT imports an external framework (Pearl's causal hierarchy and $do(\cdot)$ operator; Tishby's information bottleneck; Cramér-Rao; Sylvester's law of inertia; Lur'e's sector-condition framework; etc.) AND the framework also carries an AAT-internal segment recapitulating that framework at AAT's level of deployment, two distinct uses of the imported machinery arise:

- *Primitive-import use* — the segment uses an operator or quantity from the external framework (e.g., $do(a)$) as a primitive of the technical reader's prior. No segment-level `depends:` declaration on the AAT recapitulation segment is required, because the AAT segment is not consumed; the external machinery is.
- *AAT-deployment use* — the segment relies on the AAT-internal recapitulation's specific deployment (a definition, a sub-scope partition, a derived consequence within AAT). `depends:` on the recapitulation segment is required, per Gate-1 criterion 4.

The convention applies to Pearl's hierarchy specifically ($do$-operator imported as primitive throughout; `#def-pearl-causal-hierarchy` is the AAT recapitulation, depended-on only when its specific AAT-side deployment is consumed) and to other imported-with-internal-recapitulation cases as they arise. Articulated also at `#scope-agency` line 30 (do-operator's first use) and `#the-cycle-in-motion-intro` line 40 (first declarative articulation in Volume 1 Part I).


## Line Wrapping

Do not hard-wrap lines just to artificially impose reading width. Let renderers (GitHub, Obsidian, editors) handle wrapping. One sentence or clause per line is fine for diff-friendliness, especially with long paragraphs or paragraphs with lots of inline mathematics, but do not insert line breaks at a fixed column width. Think logical chunks and not line-length.


## File Organization

- **Segment files** live in `src/` — one claim per file.
- **Filename = slug**: `src/{slug}.md`. No numbering in filenames.
- **Canonical ordering** lives in each component's `OUTLINE.md` (e.g., `01-aat-core/OUTLINE.md`), not in filenames. The ordering will change as the theory develops; the slug is the stable identity.
- **Cross-references** use `#slug-name` — everywhere, always.

### Segment-set principle (load-bearing for tooling)

**Every non-`old-*` file in a component's `src/` directory is a segment and conforms to the cadence below.** This holds even for drafts, missing-stage entries, or segments orphaned from `OUTLINE.md`. The various stages (`missing`, `old`, `exploratory`, `draft`, `deps-verified`, `claims-verified`, `format-clean`, `candidate`) describe progress *within* FORMAT, not exemptions from it. One standing exception: chapter-intro segments and most `disc-*` discussion segments carry a cadence exemption — see the *Document Cadence* section below.

The `old-*` filename prefix is the *only* mechanism for placing a file in `src/` that is exempt from FORMAT. Those are prior-work staging files; they retain their original frontmatter (often with non-AAT `type:` tokens like `Definition`, `Theorem`) until their content is converted. Tooling skips them.

Other working material — notes, drafts, READMEs, scratch — does **not** belong in `src/`. It lives in `msc/` or at the component root.

Tools that need the canonical segment set (`bin/align-slug --all`, `bin/lint-outline`, `bin/build`) rely on this principle: they treat `{component}/src/*.md` minus `old-*.md` as authoritative. Adding a non-conforming file to `src/` will silently break these tools, so don't.


## YAML Frontmatter

Every segment file begins with:

```yaml
---
slug: the-slug-name
type: postulate
status: exact
depends:
  - prerequisite-slug-1
  - prerequisite-slug-2
---
```

### `type` — what kind of claim

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| [`postulate`](../../terminology/entries/postulate.md) | Tautological or foundational — cannot be derived, only accepted |
| [`definition`](../../terminology/entries/definition.md) | Introduces a quantity, object, or notation |
| [`scope`](../../terminology/entries/scope.md) | Restricts or broadens the domain under discussion |
| [`formulation`](../../terminology/entries/formulation.md) | Representational or modeling choice (could be different) |
| [`derived`](../../terminology/entries/derived.md) | Logical consequence of prior claims under stated assumptions |
| [`result`](../../terminology/entries/result.md) | Formally stated with a detailed derivation |
| [`corollary`](../../terminology/entries/corollary.md) | Follows directly from a theorem |
| [`hypothesis`](../../terminology/entries/hypothesis.md) | Structurally motivated, needs validation |
| [`normative`](../../terminology/entries/normative.md) | Grounded in axioms but requiring a precondition that must be verified |
| [`empirical`](../../terminology/entries/type-empirical.md) | Generalization supported by data, not fully derived |
| [`observation`](../../terminology/entries/observation.md) | Finding from simulation or empirical investigation |
| [`discussion`](../../terminology/entries/type-discussion.md) | Conceptual or normative claim used for interpretation |
| [`measurement`](../../terminology/entries/measurement.md) | Operationalization of a theoretical quantity |
| [`proposed-schema`](../../terminology/entries/proposed-schema.md) | Mathematical shape identified, formal content pending |
| [`derivation`](../../terminology/entries/derivation.md) | Complete formal derivation backing a result or derived claim |
| [`worked-example`](../../terminology/entries/worked-example.md) | End-to-end domain instantiation validating the theory chain |
| [`detail`](../../terminology/entries/detail.md) | Extended operational or technical material supporting other claims |
| [`sketch`](../../terminology/entries/type-sketch.md) | Outlines an approach or framework; direction identified, rigor pending |
| [`aside`](../../terminology/entries/aside.md) | Tangential observation or connection; informative but not load-bearing |

**Why these labels.** The terminology emphasizes that AAT is a *theoretical framework* using existing mathematics, not a pure-mathematics unification project. `postulate` (not `axiom`), `result` (not `theorem`), and `derivation` (not `proof`) avoid the framing that AAT claims foundational mathematical originality where it does not. References to external theorems keep their original names — Cox's theorem, Causal Hierarchy Theorem, Tikhonov's theorem — these are other authors' terms and renaming them would obscure provenance. Segment headings follow suit: `### Derivation`, not `### Proof Sketch`. Equation-level tags use `*[Postulate (slug)]*` and `*[Result (slug)]*`. Historical files (`_obs/`, `msc/`) are not retroactively updated — they preserve the terminology of their era.

### `status` — epistemic strength

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| [`axiomatic`](../../terminology/entries/axiomatic.md) | Foundational or tautological |
| [`exact`](../../terminology/entries/exact.md) | Mathematically validated under stated assumptions |
| [`robust-qualitative`](../../terminology/entries/robust-qualitative.md) | Survives across assumptions; specific form approximate |
| [`heuristic`](../../terminology/entries/heuristic.md) | Useful approximation; quantitative form may not hold |
| [`conditional`](../../terminology/entries/conditional.md) | Depends on explicitly named local assumptions |
| [`empirical`](../../terminology/entries/status-empirical.md) | Supported by data or simulation, not fully derived |
| [`discussion-grade`](../../terminology/entries/discussion-grade.md) | Argued qualitatively or by analogy, not derived |
| [`sketch`](../../terminology/entries/status-sketch.md) | Direction identified but formalization incomplete |

Do NOT use "Solid," "Confident," or "Plausible" as tier labels — these are not AAT terms.

### Citing simulations and empirical artifacts — `empirica:` references

Canon segments may cite registered experiments as `empirica:<experiment-slug>` (optionally `@<run-date>` for a specific recorded run) — typically in Epistemic Status, backing *[Empirical Claim (…)]* tags. The registry at root `empirica/` is canon (it travels with the Theory, like LEXICON/NOTATION; ratification refinement R3, 2026-07-16), so this is not a local-working-path violation. The contract: the cited experiment carries a `MANIFEST.md` (claims, tier, parameters, consumers — kept bidirectional with the citing segments) and the specific claim traces to a recorded run in its `RUNS.md` (date, parameters, explicit seed, output). An empirical claim citing an experiment with no matching recorded run is a truth-status defect. Full lifecycle incl. the vivarium-rerun path: [`empirica/README.md`](../../empirica/README.md).

### `depends` — prerequisite slugs

List the slugs this claim directly depends on. The type of each dependency (definition import vs logical antecedent vs scope assumption) is derivable from the referenced file's own `type` field — no typed edges needed.

### `stage` — development process state

Orthogonal to epistemic status. Tracks where the segment is in our working process, not how strong the claim is.

Stage is recorded in segment frontmatter (e.g., `stage: draft`) and in the OUTLINE.md index table. `bin/lint-outline` verifies consistency between the two (mismatches, missing/off-vocabulary values, `missing`-vs-file-exists) — **as warnings only, never gate failures**: the stage layer is known to go stale quickly under rearranging, pedagogical reorientation, and continued refinement, and is currently ignored in practice; do not read low stage values as low epistemic strength (that's `status`), and do not alarm over low acceptance counts (Joseph, 2026-07-14 — the gating methodology itself is under reconsideration; see the meta-process review's promotion-terminus question).

| Stage | Meaning | Gate to advance |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| [`missing`](../../terminology/entries/missing.md) | No segment file exists yet | — |
| `old` | Content exists only as `old-*` source material, not yet converted | Write AAT-formatted version |
| `exploratory` | Content written but deliberately held under discussion — the idea itself, or its placement, is still open; not yet on the promotion track (Joseph, 2026-07-16) | Settle the idea/placement, then → `draft` |
| [`draft`](../../terminology/entries/draft.md) | First AAT-formatted version written, not yet reviewed | — |
| [`deps-verified`](../../terminology/entries/deps-verified.md) | All dependencies audited | [Dependency audit](../../terminology/entries/dependency-audit.md) (see below) |
| [`claims-verified`](../../terminology/entries/claims-verified.md) | Content reviewed: derivations valid, labels accurate | [Content review](../../terminology/entries/content-review.md) (see below) |
| [`format-clean`](../../terminology/entries/format-clean.md) | Mechanical review passed | [Mechanical review](../../terminology/entries/mechanical-review.md) (see below) |
| [`candidate`](../../terminology/entries/candidate.md) | Ready for external challenge; Working Notes resolved | [Notes disposition](../../terminology/entries/notes-disposition.md) (see below) |

Stages are ordered: a segment at `claims-verified` has also passed `deps-verified`. A segment can be downgraded (e.g., `candidate` → `draft`) when a dependency changes, an error is found, or the claim's scope shifts.


## Promotion Workflow

Segments advance through stages by passing named gates. Each gate has a specific completion criterion — advancement encodes *what has been verified*, not how many times someone has looked at it.

### Ordering: promote in topological order

Compute the dependency DAG from `depends:` fields. Promote leaves first, then their dependents. A segment should not reach `claims-verified` while any of its dependencies is still at `draft` — you cannot verify a derivation whose premises have not been checked.

Group segments into promotion batches by DAG depth. Process all segments in a batch before advancing to the next. Within a batch, segments are independent and can be reviewed in parallel.

### Gate 1: [Dependency audit](../../terminology/entries/dependency-audit.md) → [`deps-verified`](../../terminology/entries/deps-verified.md)

For each entry in `depends:`:

1. The referenced slug exists as a segment file
2. The dependency is genuine — this segment uses the referenced segment's definitions, results, or scope conditions (not merely "related" or "mentioned in Discussion")
3. The referenced segment is itself at `deps-verified` or higher
4. No missing dependencies — if the Formal Expression uses a quantity defined elsewhere, that slug appears in `depends:`

**Completion criterion:** all dependencies verified, no missing dependencies identified.

### Gate 2: [Content review](../../terminology/entries/content-review.md) → [`claims-verified`](../../terminology/entries/claims-verified.md)

The substantive gate. For each segment, answer the three epistemic triage questions:

1. **What prior objects make this claim well-typed?** → Verify `depends:` is complete (should already be, from Gate 1)
2. **What competing formulation would also fit the prior objects?** → Verify `type:` is correct. If only one form fits the priors, it should be `derived` or `result`, not `formulation`. If several forms work and this is the most useful, it should be `formulation`. If it depends on the world, it should be `empirical` or `hypothesis`.
3. **What observation would falsify this claim in practice?** → Verify `status:` is correct. If unfalsifiable and not a definition, something is wrong.

Additionally:

- **Derivation check.** For segments with type `derived`, `result`, or `corollary`: trace each derivation step. Does each step follow from stated premises? Are all premises either in `depends:` or stated as local assumptions with equation-level tags?
- **Label audit.** Does the `status:` field match the actual epistemic strength? Common errors: labeling a formulation choice as `exact`, labeling a hypothesis as `derived`, labeling a conditional result as `exact` without flagging the condition.
- **Formal expression check.** Are equations well-typed? Do quantities have consistent units? Do boundary cases behave correctly?

**Completion criterion:** derivations valid, all labels accurate, no known issues with formal expressions. If the review reveals a mismatch, the segment returns to `draft` with a specific note about what is wrong.

### Gate 3: [Mechanical review](../../terminology/entries/mechanical-review.md) → [`format-clean`](../../terminology/entries/format-clean.md)

Separate from content review — different cognitive mode.

- Linter passes (`bin/lint-md`)
- Cross-references (`#slug-name`) resolve to existing files
- Notation matches `NOTATION.md`
- Math renders correctly in GitHub and Obsidian (check the compatibility notes above)
- Document cadence matches the template (frontmatter → title → summary → formal expression → epistemic status → discussion → working notes)
- Equation-level tags are present and correct

**Completion criterion:** all mechanical checks pass.

### Spike-segment reverse check (apply at any gate)

For each segment that was promoted from a spike in `msc/`, ask: *what did the spike establish that the segment does not say?* Not every difference is a bug — spike content is exploratory and rightly compressed during promotion — but the direction of compression should be inspected. Flag any claims where the spike's strongest or cleanest form was weakened during promotion, and judge whether the weakening reflects honest editorial compression (keep as-is), a lost promotion-blocking condition (restore to the segment), or a deferred concern that should be explicit in Working Notes.

This is a standing check rather than a gate because spike→segment compression can only be evaluated relative to the source spike, which is a historical artifact. Run the check when touching a segment for other reasons, or when a new finding surfaces the segment's derivation chain.

### Math lives in segments, not spikes

Math derived in a spike must land in a segment — never reside only in `spikes/spike-*.md`. Two destinations:

1. **An existing segment**, if the new math tightens, replaces, or extends that segment's content.
2. **A new appendix segment** (more likely for novel derivations with their own claim identity) — added to `01-aat-core/src/` (typically `appendix-*` or a similarly named slug) and recorded in `01-aat-core/OUTLINE.md` under the appendix section.

Spikes record the *attempt*, the *failed branches*, the *reasoning trail*, and pointers to where the resulting math lives. They are not the home for load-bearing derivations. The project's canonical form is the segment set: future agents and reviewers find results by looking at segments, not by archaeology through spikes; math that stays only in a spike cannot be cross-referenced, is not validated by `bin/lint-outline`, does not appear in OUTLINE.md, and is invisible to the theory.

When briefing a spike-agent, include an explicit deliverable: *"if any novel math is derived, land it in segment X (edit existing) or create appendix segment Y (new slug, added to OUTLINE.md)."* When reviewing a spike's output, verify the math has a segment destination — if it lives only in the spike, the work is not yet done.

Appendix segments are the right home for: regret-bound derivations, Fisher-information calculations, sector-condition algebra specific to a result, Cramér-Rao floor calculations, and similar derivation-heavy content that supports a main-section claim.

### Gate 4: [Notes disposition](../../terminology/entries/notes-disposition.md) → [`candidate`](../../terminology/entries/candidate.md)

Every item in `## Working Notes` must be explicitly resolved:

- **Resolved.** The answer is now incorporated into the segment's Formal Expression or Discussion. Delete the note.
- **Deferred.** The question is real but out of scope for this segment. Move it to `TODO.md` (if it's concrete open work) or a relevant spike document in `msc/` (if it's exploratory), with rationale. Delete the note from the segment.
- **Promoted.** The question warrants its own segment or is a known gap in the outline. Add cross-reference, delete the note.

A segment with unresolved Working Notes is not a candidate. The `## Working Notes` section should be empty or absent at `candidate` stage.

**Completion criterion:** Working Notes section empty or absent. The segment says what it means to say.

### When to downgrade

A segment at any stage can be downgraded to `draft` when:

- A dependency is revised in a way that affects this segment's claims
- An error is discovered in a derivation or formal expression
- The segment's scope changes (e.g., a scope condition is added or removed upstream)
- External review identifies an issue not caught in the original promotion

Downgrade to `draft`, not to an intermediate stage — the segment needs full re-review from the dependency audit forward, since the issue may have cascading effects.


## Document Cadence

1. **YAML frontmatter**
2. **Title** — `# Heading`, human-readable form of the slug
3. **One-sentence summary** — plain text, no heading, immediately after title
4. **Formal Expression** — `## Formal Expression`, with equation-level tags
5. **Epistemic Status** — `## Epistemic Status`, what's derived vs hypothesized
6. **Discussion** — `## Discussion`, interpretation, connections — brief
7. **Findings** — `## Findings` *(optional)*, curated catalog entries for distinctive contributions worth surfacing externally
8. **Working Notes** — `## Working Notes` *(optional)*, internal development notes

Definition, notation, and scope-narrowing files may use a simpler format than full claims. Corollaries and alternate formulations can live with their parent claim (they reinforce its independence), but anything that could be referenced independently should be its own file.

**Cadence exemption for intro and discussion segments (Joseph, 2026-07-14).** Chapter-intro segments and most `disc-*` discussion segments are exempt from the full cadence above (in particular `## Formal Expression` and `## Epistemic Status` are not required of them) until dedicated norms for those file kinds are worked out. These files do expository, framing, or meta-architectural work rather than making one formal claim, so the claim-segment cadence is the wrong mold for them; the exemption records that their free-form structure is deliberate, not drift. The math-in-files rules, frontmatter requirements, and OUTLINE membership still apply. When norms for these kinds are authored, they should replace this paragraph.

### Findings

The `## Findings` section is optional and exists to surface distinctive contributions into the curated catalog at root-level `FINDINGS.md`. Most segments do not carry one — that is the correct default. Definitions of standard quantities, scope statements that draw a boundary without doing definitional work, postulates accepted as foundational, derivations that back a parent result, pedagogical / illustrative material, and worked examples whose content is exhausted by the parent result they instantiate all typically lack a Findings section. A Findings section is appropriate for segments whose contribution is something an external reader would say is part of why the framework is interesting on its own merits — a result, a recognition, a partition, a synthesis, a domain transfer, a no-go, an architectural commitment.

The `bin/extract-findings` script walks every component's `OUTLINE.md`, opens each referenced segment, extracts the Findings sections that are present, and emits both a canonical `FINDINGS.md` (full per-segment catalog) and a README-shaped condensed `_findings-summary.md`. Header absent ⇒ section absent ⇒ no catalog entry from this segment. This is by design.

#### Where Findings live

Findings live in the segment whose math or naming carries the contribution. For most segments this is straightforward — the derivation segment carries the derivation's Finding, the meta-segment carries the meta-pattern's Finding. For findings whose substance lives *between* multiple segments (e.g., a diagnostic that emerges from the orthogonality of two definitions; a synthesis that names a pattern across primary instances), the natural home is a synthesis-type or narrative-type segment that takes the underlying segments as `depends:` and carries the finding there. Promoting such synthesis segments is encouraged where the cross-segment finding has its own structural integrity; cross-references-with-primary-segment are an alternative when one segment really is upstream-canonical.

A finding's content (Related Work, Impact, Brief) may freely reference dependency segments (segments earlier in the dep DAG that this segment builds on), but should not forward-reference segments that depend on this one — that would invert the dep direction inside finding content. Foundational segments at the start of a chain *may* include a brief forward navigation pointer ("see `#downstream-segment` for the finding this leads to") as orientation, but the finding's content itself lives downstream where the synthesis happens.

#### Schema

Each Finding within a `## Findings` section is introduced by an `### {Finding name}` sub-heading and carries five fields in this order:

```markdown
## Findings

### {Finding name — Title Case preferred; slug-case acceptable for cross-reference}

**Brief:** {plain-language paragraph; what this finding is and why a thoughtful generalist would care; this is the field a curious-non-specialist reader sees first.}

**Impact:** {paragraph on what the finding unlocks, closes, or forces externally; concrete enough that a reader can evaluate the claim without re-reading the formal expression.}

**Novelty Claim:** {one or two sentences naming the contribution and its claim posture — synthesis / differentiation / novelty / transfer / recognition. Lead naturally with the posture word; do not force into a closed-set label.}

**Related Work:**
- {Citation} (published YYYY, found YYYY-MM-DD) — *{relationship}* — {one-line note on the specific connection}
- {Citation} (published YYYY, found YYYY-MM-DD) — *{relationship}* — {note}
- ...

**Search Log:**
- YYYY-MM-DD (*{status}*): {one-sentence note on what was searched, what wasn't, and why this depth was right at this point}
- YYYY-MM-DD (*{status}*): {entry from a later, deeper search; older entries stay for traceability}
```

#### Multi-finding segments

When a segment carries multiple distinct findings — e.g., one segment-internal derivation that produces both a positive result and an independent no-go; one meta-segment whose synthesis claim is structurally distinct from a structural-equivalence observation — each Finding gets its own `### {name}` sub-heading. Most segments will carry one Finding; this accommodation exists for the cases where forced collapse to a single Finding would either lose an independently-citable claim or strain the Impact paragraph beyond a single coherent topic.

#### Field-by-field guidance

**[Brief](../../terminology/entries/brief-field.md).** Plain-language paragraph that a thoughtful generalist could read in 30 seconds and come away with an honest sense of what this finding is. The aspiration is the **Feynman criterion** — *if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.* A genuinely good Brief reaches for the everyday physical or causal analog that carries the load-bearing structure, in language that lets a thoughtful non-specialist *re-derive the qualitative claim from the analog alone*, without ever seeing the symbols. The canonical example for AAT's central inequality is the bathtub: water level is the gap between belief and reality, faucet flow is the rate at which reality is changing, drain rate is the agent's ability to learn, and bathtub size is how wrong the agent can be while still keeping up. Structural persistence is the condition that drain-rate-at-full exceeds faucet-flow; below it the bathtub overflows. A reader who carries that picture away has the Part I result in hand without ever meeting $\alpha$, $\rho$, or $R$. Reach for the analog whose physics or causal structure is *isomorphic* to the finding's load-bearing structure, not merely evocative — the test is whether a reader can predict the qualitative consequences of perturbing the analog and have those predictions hold against the formalism. Use technical language where there is no plain-language equivalent that preserves meaning, but pause to define or anchor it the first time. The Brief is consistently the most-valuable field for external adoption — it is the field that decides whether an interested reader engages further. Do not let it become a translation-of-the-Impact-paragraph; it should stand on its own.

The same Feynman-criterion aspiration governs framing-level prose elsewhere (README, OUTLINE preambles, paper introductions, pedagogical material). The Brief field happens to be where the aspiration is institutionalized in the schema, but the principle is general: where the framework is meeting a non-specialist reader, the load-bearing structure should be portable to an everyday analog. The bathtub gloss for `#result-persistence-condition` came not from us but from Alan Walton, a mathematician-practitioner working it out himself on first encounter; that the analog could be reconstructed by a sympathetic outside reader without our prompting is itself a useful diagnostic. Where we have not produced the analog ourselves, the segment is not yet at Feynman criterion.

**[Impact](../../terminology/entries/impact-field.md).** Paragraph on what this finding *does* in the framework — what it unlocks, what it closes, what it forces. Cross-references to other segments are encouraged where they carry weight (a finding that resolves a previously-flagged GAP, or that lifts a prior result's status, or that makes a downstream construction newly possible). Do not duplicate the Discussion section; Impact is catalog-grade external positioning, while Discussion is in-segment context.

**[Novelty Claim](../../terminology/entries/novelty-claim-field.md).** One or two sentences in prose, naturally leading with a claim posture:

- *[Claim synthesis](../../terminology/entries/synthesis-posture.md) on...* — when the finding integrates multiple prior bodies of work in a way no single prior captures.
- *[Claim differentiation](../../terminology/entries/differentiation-posture.md) on...* — when the finding sharpens or extends prior work; the precursor exists but the extension is the contribution.
- *[Claim novelty](../../terminology/entries/novelty-posture.md) on...* — when no direct anticipation has been found at the search depth conducted; the result stands as fresh.
- *[Claim transfer](../../terminology/entries/transfer-posture.md) of X into Y* — when established machinery is being applied to a new domain where it had not been formally instantiated.
- *[Claim recognition](../../terminology/entries/recognition-posture.md) of structural equivalence (or pattern) between X and Y* — when the contribution is recognizing an internal equivalence or a cross-segment pattern, rather than producing a new derivation.

These postures are open prose, not a closed enum; the sweep can converge on additional postures as needed. The point is to make the *kind of claim* visible at a glance, with the prose carrying the substance.

**[Related Work](../../terminology/entries/related-work-field.md).** One entry per prior work that bears on this finding. Each entry carries (a) citation, (b) publication date — useful for catching anachronism (something published 2024 cannot be precursor to something derived 2025), (c) date the project found the work, (d) a relationship label, (e) a one-line note on the specific connection.

Two presentation forms are permitted; choose whichever fits the prior-art landscape:

*Bulleted form* — appropriate when the prior-art landscape is simple (one to a handful of relevant priors, each bearing on the finding as a whole):

```markdown
**Related Work:**
- {Citation} (published YYYY, found YYYY-MM-DD) — *{relationship}* — {note}
- {Citation} (published YYYY, found YYYY-MM-DD) — *{relationship}* — {note}
```

*Table form* — appropriate for findings with richer landscapes where multiple aspects of the finding bear differently on different priors (the pattern used in `ref/Novelty_defense_and_integration.md`'s per-pillar tables). Columns: an aspect of the finding ("ASF concern"), what prior art has on that aspect ("Prior-art language"), and how the finding sits against it ("Relationship / Positioning"):

```markdown
**Related Work:**

| ASF concern | Prior-art language | Relationship / Positioning |
|---|---|---|
| {one aspect of the finding} | {what prior art has, with citation, publication date, found date} | *{relationship}* — {note} |
| {another aspect} | {another or same prior, with dates} | *{relationship}* — {note} |
```

The table form is encouraged where the finding's prior-art positioning has substructure — where reducing to a flat list would lose the per-aspect differentiation that makes the claim defensible. The bulleted form is encouraged where a flat list captures the landscape honestly.

Suggested relationship labels (open-ended; the sweep can add):

- *formal antecedent* — adopted mathematical machinery, cited and used in the derivation.
- *conceptual precursor* — earlier informal or empirical version of the idea; the finding formalizes or sharpens it.
- *convergent independent* — independent arrival at substantially the same conclusion under different framing or scope.
- *direct anticipation* — prior work got there first; properly attributed.
- *partial anticipation* — overlapping but distinct (different scope, framing, or domain).
- *formalized by this finding* — earlier informal claim given mathematical form here.
- *verified by this finding* — empirical or formal confirmation of prior theory.
- *contradicted by this finding* — ASF disagrees with this prior work.
- *empirical instantiation supporting / against* — concrete case from the literature that bears on the finding.
- *adjacent literature* — relevant context that informs reading but is not directly antecedent.

**[Search Log](../../terminology/entries/search-log-field.md).** Dated entries that disclose what literature search has been conducted and how. Each entry records (a) the date, (b) the search status ([`not-conducted`](../../terminology/entries/not-conducted.md) / [`cursory`](../../terminology/entries/cursory.md) / [`targeted`](../../terminology/entries/targeted.md) / [`nominally-comprehensive`](../../terminology/entries/nominally-comprehensive.md) / [`comprehensive`](../../terminology/entries/comprehensive.md) / [`intuition-only`](../../terminology/entries/intuition-only.md)), (c) a one-sentence note on what was searched and what was not. As searches deepen over time, new entries are appended (older entries stay for traceability). The `nominally-comprehensive` tier covers automated comprehensive-search tools (e.g., Undermind reports) that survey literature broadly but do not reach the depth a human researcher with domain knowledge would call truly comprehensive — they are stronger than `targeted` and weaker than `comprehensive` in the strict sense. The `comprehensive` tier is reserved for searches that have been pushed to that depth (multiple iterations, deliberate corner-case probing, expert review). When a finding has been through a pillar-level prior-art defense (e.g., an Undermind report), the Search Log entry references the defense document and tags the depth honestly.

The author creating or promoting a segment is welcome to include an *intuition entry* — what their pre-search instinct says about where prior art might lie, where the well-known form of the result might trace to, or which adjacent literatures would be the natural search targets. For AI agents, this includes intuitions grounded in training rather than in active retrieval; for humans, it includes informed-but-unconfirmed expectations. Tagging the entry status as `intuition-only` makes the source explicit. Intuition entries are valuable: they orient future targeted searches, they make the agent's training-derived priors visible (so they can be confirmed or refuted by later evidence), and they prevent the schema from forcing silence in cases where genuine search has not yet been done. An honest intuition entry beats no entry.

The Search Log is the discipline that prevents `Claim novelty on...` from being hubris. A claim of novelty under cursory search is honest; a claim of novelty under comprehensive search is much stronger; a claim of novelty backed only by intuition is weaker still but still better than implicit. Future agents reading the catalog should be able to see at a glance both the claim and what backs it.

#### Tier comes from frontmatter, not Findings

The segment's `status:` frontmatter field carries its epistemic tier (`exact` / `robust qualitative` / `heuristic` / `conditional` / `discussion-grade` / etc., per Epistemic Triage). Findings sections do not duplicate the tier — the extractor reads `status:` from frontmatter and surfaces it alongside the Finding in the catalog. This separates *what kind of contribution* (the Findings section's job) from *how well-established* (the segment's job, anchored in Epistemic Status).

#### Voice and ordering

Findings are written in the segment voice (per *Voice and provenance* below) — not as a chronicle of the cycle that produced the finding, but as the framework speaking about its own contribution. Date stamps belong only in the Search Log. Spike references belong only in `## Working Notes`.

Field ordering is fixed: Brief / Impact / Novelty Claim / Related Work / Search Log. The reader-facing motivation is that Brief carries the catalog reader, Impact says why it matters, Novelty Claim positions the contribution, Related Work shows the receipts, and Search Log discloses the search-state honesty. Catalog extraction relies on this ordering.

### Working Notes

The `## Working Notes` section is for active development: open questions about the claim, sketches of how AAT machinery might strengthen or weaken it, unresolved issues, things to check. This is *our* working space — what we're thinking about, not what we're asserting. It should be removed or emptied when the segment reaches `candidate` stage. Unlike the Discussion section (which is part of the published theory), Working Notes are process artifacts.

**What earns a Working Note** (the authoritative statement; other docs point here). A Working Note earns its place *only if it assists future work*. Three legitimate kinds: **forward pointers** (open follow-on, gating sub-spikes, unresolved questions); **regression-guards** (a disconfirmed prediction or deliberately-corrected-away form, recorded so it is not re-attempted or re-landed); **dead-end warnings** (an approach found not to work). What does *not* belong, even though Working Notes are not canon: **vanity-changelog** — pure past-work narration ("previously carried X," "the audit recommended a soften"); that is `CHANGELOG.md`'s job, and the urge is strongest exactly when the fix was a *deletion*, so there's no artifact to point at — and **unneeded spike/artifact references**, which not only clutter but *pin the spike in place*, tripping the spike-archivability test ([`spikes.sop.md`](spikes.sop.md) §2-bis(2)). "Not canon" licenses forward-work content, not backward-narration.

### Voice and provenance

**Segment voice, not diff voice.** Formal Expression, Epistemic Status, and Discussion present the current state of the theory. Avoid phrasing like "landed 2026-04-23", "the prior version of this segment treated X as...", "the spikes/spike-Y.md cycle lifted...", or "promoted from spike Z" in those sections — that voice positions the content *against* the theory rather than presenting the segment *as* the theory. State what the theory **is**, not what changed: "Instance 3 of #disc-identifiability-floor derives..." rather than "Instance 3 (landed 2026-04-23 from spike X) derives..."; "the four instances of the meta-pattern..." rather than "the meta-pattern was extended to four instances after the 2026-04-23 cycle...".

A segment is read by future agents and reviewers who have no context for the chronicle of changes; diff voice forces them to imagine the prior state in order to parse the new state, dates the segment, and positions the content as contingent. Date / commit / spike references belong in the history layer (`CHANGELOG.md` / the cycle tracking file); a `## Working Notes` carries one *only* when it is a forward-pointer, regression-guard, or dead-end warning per *What earns a Working Note* above — not as standalone provenance.

**Spike references only in Working Notes, only for unfinished work.** Once promoted, a derivation's validity is established by the segment's own argument, not by "see spike X for the full derivation." No spike-X citations in Formal Expression / Epistemic Status / Discussion. If a derivation is promoted, state the derivation; if a result has Monte Carlo verification, state the verification's parameters and outcome in the segment itself.

Spike references in `## Working Notes` are permitted in two narrow forms:

1. **Pointer to unfinished follow-on work.** "The N-agent scaling is unresolved; framing lives in `spikes/spike-composition-scaling-N.md`." Once the follow-on lands, the Working Note is replaced by segment content and the spike reference comes out with it.
2. **Regression-guard or dead-end pointer.** "An earlier attempt to derive this via route Y was disconfirmed (`spike-X.md`) — don't re-land it." A spike reference earns its place by guarding future work, not by narrating provenance; bare landing-context ("derived in the Gap-cycle trail") is history-layer content, not a Working Note (the `depends` list and citations already carry what a reviewer needs).

Cross-references between segments (`#other-segment`) are unrestricted in any section — they are the normal way segments interoperate. The rule is specifically about spike references, which are transient artifacts. The test: a reader with no knowledge of which spike produced which segment should be able to read any segment as a coherent piece of theory; spike files can vanish without invalidating it.

### Derivation-audit table *(optional; recommended for derivation-type segments)*

Derivation segments, and any segment that carries multiple claims at distinct epistemic strengths, benefit from an executive-summary table that makes each claim's source and tier visible at a glance. The convention is modelled on `#deriv-graph-structure-uniqueness`'s "What Is Derived vs. What Is Chosen" table. It pre-empts the "is X derived or chosen?" ambiguity that fresh readers repeatedly stumble on, and serves as the segment-level counterpart to the claim-level equation tags (`*[Derived]*`, `*[Formulation]*`, etc.).

**Location.** Near the end of `## Formal Expression`, before `## Epistemic Status`, under a `### What Is Derived vs. What Is Chosen` heading (exact title may vary — e.g., `### Derivation Audit`, `### Derived vs. Chosen vs. Assumed` — as long as the three columns are the same).

**Format.** Three columns:

| Property | Source | Strength |
|---|---|---|
| *(what the segment claims or defines)* | *(postulate, prior segment, external theorem, or formulation choice)* | *(tier label; see vocabulary below)* |

**Strength vocabulary.** Prefer the TFT tier words already in use for equation-level tags (see §Equation-Level Tags below) so the table aligns with the Epistemic Status paragraph:

- **Proved** — derived from stated priors with a closed-form argument in this segment. Reserve for clean theorem-like claims. Equivalent to *exact*-tier.
- **Derived** — follows from priors, possibly under stated conditions. If conditions are load-bearing, use "Derived (conditional on *X*)".
- **Robust qualitative** — the qualitative claim survives across modeling choices, though a specific functional form is approximate.
- **Heuristic** — the claim is useful operational guidance; a formal tier is not in hand.
- **Formulation choice** — a representational selection motivated by parsimony / domain fit / downstream tractability, not mathematical necessity.
- **Hypothesis** — a claim offered for test, not yet derived.
- **Discussion-grade** — a positional observation, not a derivation.
- **Empirical** — the claim is about the world and awaits validation.

**When to use the table.** Required by review practice only for `type: derivation` segments with three or more claims of mixed strength. Strongly recommended for appendix segments with load-bearing derivations that multiple downstream segments cite. Optional for other segments; a short Epistemic Status paragraph may suffice when only one or two claims are load-bearing.

**What the table is not.** It is not a substitute for the `## Epistemic Status` paragraph. The paragraph explains *why* each claim sits at its tier and names the max attainable status; the table gives the reader a one-screen executive summary of the same content. Both should co-exist on derivation segments; each does work the other cannot.

**Companion convention (C-BP4, if adopted).** Claim-level statuses inside equation tags (e.g., `*[Derived, status: exact]*`) would serve as the inline implementation; the derivation-audit table is the segment-level executive summary. The two compose — table is reader-facing overview; tags are proximate to the math.


## Epistemic Triage

Three questions to ask when writing or reviewing any segment. These determine the segment's honest `type` and `status` — and, critically, its **maximum attainable status** (the strongest epistemic category it could ever occupy, regardless of additional work).

### The three questions

1. **What prior objects make this claim well-typed?** Which definitions, axioms, or derived results must exist for this claim to even be statable? If the answer is "none" or "only standard math," the claim may be foundational. If it requires many prior objects, it sits later in the dependency chain.

2. **What competing formulation would also fit the prior objects?** If the answer is "none — this is the only form compatible with the priors," the claim may be a theorem candidate (mathematical inevitability). If several forms work and you're choosing the most useful one, it's a formulation or design principle. Be honest: most claims have alternatives.

3. **What observation would falsify this claim in practice?** If a concrete falsifier exists, the claim is empirical or hypothesis. If no observation could distinguish it from alternatives, it may be a definition or tautology, not a testable claim. If it's unfalsifiable *and* not a definition, something is wrong.

### Diagnostic

| If... | Then the segment is probably... |
|-------|--------------------------------|
| Only one form fits the priors | Theorem candidate (derived, exact) |
| Several forms fit; this is the cleanest | Formulation (canonical choice) |
| Depends on the world, not the formalism | Empirical or hypothesis |
| No falsifier and not a definition | Tautology or under-specified — revisit |

### Max attainable status

Each segment has a ceiling — the strongest epistemic status it could ever reach, no matter how much work is invested. A segment whose functional form is inherently empirical (e.g., #hyp-conceptual-alignment) will never become `exact`; investing effort to "prove" it is wasted. A segment that's discussion-grade because it hasn't been worked yet (e.g., a sketch with a clear proof path) may have `exact` as its ceiling.

When the ceiling is clear, note it in the segment's Epistemic Status paragraph: *"Max attainable: [status]. Currently [status] because [reason]."* This prevents wasted effort and focuses energy where promotion is possible.

### Three rings of segment content

The triage above classifies individual segments; applied across the theory, it produces a coarse structure of three concentric rings. Knowing which ring a segment sits in determines how to review it, what to invest in, and when to stop pushing.

**Inevitability core (~15 segments).** Segments where the goal is "given the prior objects, this is the *only* compatible form." Mathematical inevitability is the ceiling. Review focus: tightening the derivation until no alternative formulation escapes.

The current inevitability-core members, with why inevitability is plausible:

| Segment | Why inevitability is plausible |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| #der-recursive-update + #deriv-recursive-update | Three constraints → unique recursive form. Strongest result in the theory. |
| #result-mismatch-decomposition | Bias-variance decomposition: mathematical identity once mismatch is defined. |
| #der-chain-confidence-decay | log(product) = sum(logs). Pure algebraic identity. |
| #result-persistence-condition | Given sector conditions, the threshold follows by Lyapunov. |
| #result-sector-condition-stability + #deriv-sector-condition | Lyapunov stability result applied to mismatch dynamics. |
| #result-sector-persistence-template | Abstract Lyapunov argument; six AAT results instantiate it. |
| #result-structural-adaptation-necessity | Parametric update converges within model class; wrong class forces structural change. |
| #der-orient-cascade | Resolution order forced by information dependency ( $M_t$ before $\Sigma_t$ before $O_t$ ). |
| #def-satisfaction-gap / #def-control-regret | Arithmetic once $V_{\text{ideal}}, A_O, V_{\text{current}}$ are defined. Diagnostic value is the insight. |
| #der-causal-hierarchy-requirement | Application of Bareinboim et al.'s causal hierarchy result to $Q_O$ evaluation. |
| #der-loop-interventional-access | Feedback loop generates interventional data by construction. |
| #der-directed-separation | $f_M$ independence from $G_t$ follows from the update structure, given scope condition. |
| #der-deliberation-cost | Think-vs-act threshold from information-theoretic argument. |
| #disc-composition-consistency | If scope condition doesn't restrict level, predictions at different levels must be compatible. |
| #deriv-graph-structure-uniqueness | Four operational postulates + causal sufficiency force a Markov-factorized DAG (Cox-analog). |

**Canonical formulations (second ring).** Good representational choices that are motivated but not forced. Triage question 2 ("what competing formulation would also fit?") answers "at least one alternative exists." Review focus: explaining the choice, noting alternatives, and guarding against drift toward inevitability claims that aren't there.

Current members include: #form-complete-agent-state, #form-objective-functional, #def-value-object, #def-strategy-dimension, #def-strategy-dag, #scope-and-or, #form-agent-model, #form-information-bottleneck, #form-event-driven-dynamics, #def-adaptive-tempo, #form-structural-change-as-parametric-limit, #norm-explicit-strategy-condition (normative, not derived), #form-composition-closure (operationalizes #disc-composition-consistency but is one formulation among several possible ones), most definitions.

**Empirical, heuristic, discussion (third ring).** Claims whose ceiling is empirical or heuristic — testable against the world but not derivable from the formalism. This is *not* a demotion: these are where AAT becomes falsifiable and useful. Review focus: stating falsifiable predictions, connecting to validation, resisting the temptation to dress empirical claims as derivations.

Current members include: #emp-update-gain, #hyp-mismatch-dynamics, #hyp-edge-update-via-gain, #def-strategic-calibration, #hyp-communication-gain, #hyp-conceptual-alignment, #hyp-exponential-cognitive-load, #emp-changeset-size-principle, most TST and logogenic-agent segments, simulation observations.

**Usage.** When developing or reviewing a segment, first locate its ring. If it's inevitability-core, the goal is tightening the proof. If it's a canonical formulation, the goal is explaining the choice and noting alternatives. If it's empirical/heuristic, the goal is stating falsifiable predictions and connecting to validation. Don't push segments upward beyond their ceiling; don't leave core segments at sketch status when a proof is within reach. The ring assignment is not part of segment frontmatter — it's an analytical stance the reviewer takes.


## Equation-Level Tags

Inline tags before equations mark their epistemic status. These follow TFT conventions (see `NOTATION.md` and `_obs/old-tf-00-notation-conventions.md`):

```
*[Definition (slug-name)]*
*[Derived (slug-name, from ...)]*
*[Derived (Conditional on ...)]*
*[Hypothesis]*
*[Empirical Claim]*
*[Formulation]*
*[Discussion]*
*[Assumption]*
*[Postulate (slug-name)]*
```


## Cross-References

- **In running text**: `#slug-name` — readable, grep-able, meaningful
- **As links from src/ files** (within the same component): `[#slug-name](slug-name.md)` (relative)
- **As links from a component-root outline** (e.g., `01-aat-core/OUTLINE.md`): `[#slug-name](src/slug-name.md)`
- **As links from a repo-root file** (e.g., `OUTLINE.md`, `README.md`, `LEXICON.md`): include the component prefix, e.g., `[#slug-name](01-aat-core/src/slug-name.md)`

Both forms work in GitHub and Obsidian. The plain `#slug-name` form is preferred in running prose where clickability is less important than readability.

**Forward references are expected.** Segments routinely reference not-yet-written segments via `#slug-name`. These are intentional dependency markers — they document the claim's connections within the theory even before the target segment exists. Do not treat them as broken links or remove them.

**Obsidian tag recognition**: Obsidian treats `#word` as a tag only when preceded by a space (or start of line). Always ensure a space before `#slug-name` — write `( #scope-agency)` not `(#scope-agency)`, and `see #emp-update-gain` not `see#emp-update-gain`.


## Math Formatting

AAT uses standard LaTeX math that renders in both GitHub and Obsidian.

- **Inline**: `$...$` — no space after opening `$`, no space before closing `$`
- **Display**: `$$...$$` — on their own lines, blank line before and after

### Compatibility Notes

GitHub's math renderer is stricter than Obsidian's. To keep both working:

- No space immediately after `$` or before closing `$`:
  `$x^2$` not `$ x^2 $`
- Display math delimiters `$$` must be on their own lines
- Use `\begin{aligned}` inside `$$...$$` instead of `\begin{align}` (the latter is a top-level environment that conflicts with `$$` wrapping)
- `\text{}` works in both for words inside math
- `\operatorname{}` for multi-letter operators (e.g., `$\operatorname{argmin}$`)
- **Vertical bars**: use `\vert` (not `|`) for single bars and `\Vert` (not `\|`) for double bars, everywhere in math — not just in tables. Raw `|` is ambiguous (conditional? delimiter? absolute value?) and breaks inside markdown table cells; `\|` has inconsistent rendering. For matched delimiters (absolute value, norms, set-builder notation), prefer `\lvert`/`\rvert` and `\lVert`/`\rVert` respectively
- Subscripts/superscripts with multiple characters need braces:
  `$x_{t+1}$` not `$x_t+1$`
- Avoid raw `<` and `>` in math — use `\lt` and `\gt` (GitHub can interpret these as HTML tags, breaking the math span and corrupting everything after the `>`)
- **Asterisks in inline math**: use `\ast` instead of bare `*` inside `$...$`. Markdown's italic/bold parser runs before the math renderer, so `$\eta^*$` can be parsed as `$\eta^` + italic start, destroying the expression. Write `$\eta^\ast$` or `$\eta^{\ast}$`. Display math (`$$...$$` on own lines) is unaffected
- **Underscores and emphasis interference**: when multiple inline `$...$` spans on the same line contain `_` after a non-alphanumeric character (like `}`), GitHub's emphasis parser can match the `_` characters as italic delimiters *across* math spans, breaking all affected expressions. Fix: remove optional braces from single-character command arguments before `_` — write `$\hat P_\Sigma$` not `$\hat{P}_\Sigma$`, and `$\mathcal T_c$` not `$\mathcal{T}_c$`. The braces are optional for single-char arguments and removing them places an alpha character before `_`, which disables GFM emphasis. For nested commands like `$\hat{\mathcal{T}}_t$` where braces can't be removed, restructure the line so only one subscript-bearing expression appears per line. The linter's `--fix` mode handles the brace-removal cases automatically
- **Underscores in `\text{}`**: bare `_` inside `\text{}` can break GitHub rendering (the `_` triggers subscript in math mode and emphasis in markdown). Use `-` instead: `$\mathcal{T}_{\text{obs-noise}}$` not `$\mathcal{T}_{\text{obs_noise}}$`. The linter auto-fixes `_` → `-` inside `\text{}`
- **Slug-refs stay at the prose layer — no `#slug` inside math**: project-internal `#segment-name` cross-references are markdown-layer constructs (Obsidian-style internal links), not mathematical objects. They MUST NOT appear anywhere inside math mode — neither directly inside `$...$` / `$$...$$`, nor inside any math-mode construct like `\text{}`, `\boxed{}`, `\underbrace{}_{}`, `\overbrace{}^{}`, `\tag{}`, or any other text-bearing math command. Two reasons: (i) LaTeX reads `#` as a macro-parameter token, which breaks rendering; (ii) the slug-ref is semantically a prose cross-reference, not a math object — the conflation muddies the math-vs-prose layers and makes the math less portable to LaTeX/PDF output. **Pattern**: lift the slug-ref into surrounding prose (`As stated in #segment-name, the condition is:` then the math), and use math-natural labels inside the math (a named condition abbreviated to a symbol like $\mathcal{S}_c$; a descriptive phrase without `#` like `\underbrace{...}_{\text{structural persistence}}`). The underbrace / `\boxed{}` / `\tag{}` should label *what* the expression is, not *where* it lives — provenance belongs in the prose, not in the math.


## Notation Conventions

Follow TFT conventions. See `NOTATION.md` for AAT's symbol reference. The original TFT conventions are in `_obs/old-tf-00-notation-conventions.md`. Key points:

- **Calligraphic** ($\mathcal{M}$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{A}$, $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{E}$) for sets and spaces
- **$\mathcal{T}$** for adaptive tempo (calligraphic to distinguish from temperature)
- **$\lVert\cdot\rVert$** for norms (mismatch magnitude); **$\lvert\cdot\rvert$** for cardinality
- **Subscript $t$**: discrete time or macroscopic continuous time
- **Subscript $\tau$**: continuous event timestamp (microscopic)
- **Superscript $(k)$**: channel index
- **$\mathcal C_t$** for chronica (interaction history) — not $\mathcal{H}$ (avoids collision with entropy)
