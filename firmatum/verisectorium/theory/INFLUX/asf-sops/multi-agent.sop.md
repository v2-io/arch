# Multi-agent work — orchestration patterns

> [!note]
> **Status:** authoritative (consolidates the project's multi-agent methods, previously sole-carried in project memory).
> **Owns:** *how* to run multi-agent cycles in this repo — the cycle shapes (pilot-then-sweep, verification cadence, parallel sweep, consolidation-audit, voting, cluster reconciliation), the workflow-restatement gate, the two recurring subagent failure modes, and the operational footguns. The *register* you brief in is disposition and lives elsewhere (next section).
> **See also:** `~/.claude/memory/collaboration/peer-voice.md` + project memory `feedback_peer_to_peer_voice_when_instructing_agents` (the delegation stance — auto-loaded, read before briefing) · [`git-hygiene.sop.md`](git-hygiene.sop.md) (commit granularity, which the sweep patterns lean on) · [`spikes.sop.md`](spikes.sop.md) · [`naming.sop.md`](naming.sop.md) (its cycle *is* the voting pattern).

## Before anything: the brief is a delegation, not a script

The single most load-bearing thing about working with other agents here isn't a pattern — it's the register you write the brief in, and it's **disposition, so it isn't restated in this file**. Read `peer-voice.md` before you write a brief. The one-line version, only as a reminder of what to go read: you default to writing the prescriptive register that's productive for directing *yourself*, and across the delegation boundary that same register collapses the receiving agent's deliberation-space into your action-space. The fix is a second pass over the drafted brief, cutting the instinctive prescription that isn't genuinely-unavailable context. Everything below assumes that register; the patterns are *what* to orchestrate, not license to command while doing it.

## Choosing the shape

The patterns below aren't a menu of equals — they answer different questions. A quick map:

- **Landing a project-wide convention** (rename, format migration, slug discipline) → *pilot-then-sweep*, and if the sweep is large and parallel, the *parallel-sweep commit cadence*.
- **A whole-corpus mechanical refactor** where each edit could silently corrupt → *verification cadence* (a different agent verifies each batch).
- **A portfolio grown too big to hold in one head** (proposals, findings) → *consolidation-audit*.
- **A taste decision with no single right answer** (naming) → *multi-agent voting* across architectures.
- **Cluster/spike work that ran in isolation while canon moved underneath it** → *cluster reconciliation* before landing.

Most real cycles compose several — pilot-then-sweep often *contains* a verification cadence and ends in a consolidation pass.

## Pilot-then-sweep — the breadth-compression cycle

Project-wide changes land in stages, not one big-bang sweep, because **the pilot is what exposes the gaps the spec didn't know it had**. The ladder: **pilot** (3–10 deliberately diverse instances, landed as its own commit) → **validate** (read the pilot through the principles; does it read well in context? what edge cases surfaced?) → **tool** (build the script that automates the mechanical part — dry-run, idempotent, no-op on already-aligned cases) → **audit** (a *thorough* agent, not a quick skim, checks whatever inputs the tool trusts as authoritative — this is precisely where silent-corruption cases get caught before they propagate to ~140 segments) → **sweep** (run the tool; expect a large but balanced diff) → **cleanup** (the content the tool couldn't reach — its own separate commit, not bundled into the sweep).

The discipline underneath is *separate mechanical passes from judgment passes*. The test for which a change is: can the rule be encoded in ~20 lines of script unambiguously? If yes, it's a mechanical pass; if no, it's a judgment cycle with review. Bundling the two ("validate the convention" + "apply it everywhere" in one motion) is the thing to avoid.

Worked instance: the 2026-04-24 role-prefix cycle walked the full ladder (pilot `09ace17`→`0b9cd24` → tool `bin/align-slug` → opus audit → sweep `e6adf9e` → bug-cleanup `f8bc46a`). The cost of nearly skipping the thorough audit was real: an early lightweight audit miscounted schema instances (claimed 9, actual 1) and missed a mechanical bug that would have silently corrupted 142 renames.

## Verification cadence — for whole-corpus refactors

For renames and structural sweeps across many files, the leverage comes from **independence: the agent that just made every edit is the worst-placed to see what it got wrong.** So a *different* agent (or a fresh-context read across a session boundary) verifies each batch before the next starts. Coordinate through a live tracking file as the rendezvous, with a per-row state machine `untouched → modified → verified` and a stated retirement condition. Verification runs *in parallel* with surgery on still-untouched rows, so it isn't a bottleneck.

A cost-asymmetric split that works: a breadth-fast agent does the edits, a long-context agent does the cross-segment-consistency verify — but the discipline is "a *different* agent verifies," not any specific model pairing. Run one independent skeptical-reader audit over the whole branch before merge; merge `--no-ff` to preserve the verification-pair commit structure. Validated by the 2026-05-09 GUC rename (8 phases / ~60 files / 22 commits); the cadence caught wrong-label rows, semantic-reversal corruptions, and two pre-existing bugs the rename incidentally surfaced. Pattern artifacts: `msc/class-rename-{execution-plan,tracking}-2026-05-09.md`.

## Parallel sweep — agents edit, parent commits

When a sweep is big enough to run ≥3 agents in parallel over shared canon, **don't have the agents commit their own work.** Two problems dissolve at once if the parent owns the commit: parallel agents committing simultaneously race and muddle attribution (one agent's commit sweeps up a sibling's half-done edits); and reviewing each batch's diff before committing gives you the window to catch a *frame defect in the brief* and refine the next batch. The cadence: launch parallel batch → review diffs (`git status --short`, `bin/lint-md`, spot-check 1–2) → commit the batch as one logical unit → refine the brief if the diffs revealed a systematic misread → launch the next batch.

So the brief tells each agent plainly: **edit the working tree only; do not commit — the parent commits after reviewing diffs.** That's a tooling constraint, not a posture downgrade — the rest of the brief stays peer-voice. Worked instance: the 2026-05-21 summary-attempt sweep (5 batches × ~4 agents × ~5–12 files ≈ 143 segments), where each batch's defects sharpened the next batch's brief, landing as five clean batch-commits + one cleanup. (Commit granularity itself — one commit per batch, never one blob — lives in [`git-hygiene.sop.md`](git-hygiene.sop.md).)

## Consolidation-audit — for portfolios too big to reason about whole

When a portfolio (proposals, findings, a backlog) grows past the point you can hold it in one head: **partition into ~4–6 clusters balanced for size, launch one richly-briefed agent per cluster against a shared per-item schema, spot-check against primary sources, then synthesize into a banded structure.** A schema that has worked, per item: current status (% landed), remaining scope (in segments × magnitude, not time), prerequisites/follow-ups, aspects targeted, a now/soon/later/wait/retire judgment, a value score, subsumption/supersession, a freshness check. Synthesize into bands (absorbed/ready/soon/later/wait/retired) and replace the old doc, moving it to `_obs/` with a supersession header. Name the methodology as it emerges so a future cycle recognizes the same structural conditions. (Spot-checking against the source is not optional — agent summaries drift at the structural level; see `feedback_primary_source_verification`.)

## Multi-agent voting — for taste decisions

For decisions where aesthetic judgment matters and there's no single correct answer (the naming cycle is the canonical case — see [`naming.sop.md`](naming.sop.md)): a shared **principles file first**; a **cold-start Round 1** where each agent builds its own list from primary sources without anchoring on others' votes (diversity-of-discoveries is the whole point of not seeding); **≥3 architectures** deliberately (Claude-family shares aesthetic priors — adding Codex and Gemini brings architecturally-independent ones, and the *disagreement* is the valuable data); a **tabular format** with explicit weight rows (absence ≠ vote); a **blind Round 2** (sort by R1 aggregate, withhold tallies, keep reasoning) to prevent bandwagon convergence; a **collision audit** (web-search external naming collisions on top candidates) before finalizing; and the **principles file evolves between rounds** as R1 surfaces its gaps. Aggregation is scripted (`bin/naming-aggregate.rb`) to handle multi-table files, escaped pipes, dedup, and weight-conflict warnings.

## Cluster reconciliation — when isolated work meets moved canon

When cluster/spike work (a literature sweep, an enrichment pass) runs in *parallel-isolation* while an active executor is mid-integration cycle, **dispatch a secondary reconciliation spike before landing any of the cluster's results.** The reconciliation question is structurally invisible from inside either workstream: the executor knows the canon they're changing but not what the cluster found; the cluster knows the external content but not what just landed. Skip it and the cluster's landings will re-derive what just landed under different vocabulary, collide on naming, or miss that their actual contribution is sharper/narrower than the cluster verdict claims — all three happened in the 2026-05-22 enrichment cycle and were caught only by the explicit reconciliation spike (`spikes/spike-integration-reconciliation-2026-05-22/`). The reconciliation brief names the cluster verdicts, the *current* canon state (including segments landed since the cluster began), and the questions — what's genuinely new, what's been front-run, what collides — and outputs a phased plan. Run *strengthen-first* attempts on the surfaced candidates next; only land after both layers return. This composes with strengthen-before-soften and integration-is-replacement (a wrong recognition-tier landing avoided here is a deletion cycle saved later).

## The workflow-restatement gate

For any high-stakes multi-agent cycle, a **workflow-restatement prerequisite** earns its place by doing double duty. Asking each agent, before they start, to restate the workflow in their own words (plus: instincts that cut against it, patterns to avoid, *feedback on under-specified spots*, and an atypical-effort prompt) binds them to the standard through reconstructive articulation — *and* it turns them into a reviewer of your instructions at exactly the moment their fresh-read confusion is most diagnostic. On 2026-04-30 all three R2 voters independently surfaced a real instruction-set bug (an R1 `+3`/`+2` scale holdover) at the restatement stage, before it could affect a single vote. Treat the instruction-feedback answer as a live input channel: read the restatements before launching the next cohort, fix what they surface, reference the fix when you launch them. The five-question structure is what makes it productive — a weaker "any questions?" gate doesn't produce the same signal.

## Two recurring failure modes with subagents

**Questions are framing-diagnostic, not behavior-to-fix.** When a subagent comes back with questions (especially question-with-recommendation pairs), it usually isn't failing to commit — it's signaling that the frame and role-identity it needs for *authentic* confidence weren't in the brief. Pre-answering the questions in a tighter follow-up patches the symptom; the cause is the missing frame. Two things follow. (1) *Brief length is inversely proportional to room for authentic ownership* — the questions you pre-empt are often the very ones whose presence would have told you what framing was missing. (2) *Role-identity / aesthetic standard is load-bearing where task-description is not* — "you have judgment, use it" is empty without a standard the judgment can land in; "do what you'd be most proud of" gives it something to be about. For one-shot launches where ambiguity is plausible, a **two-shot pattern** captures the dialog benefit: launch the first agent purely to diagnose ("when you know what you'll do or what to resolve first, report back"), let its surfacings refine *the prompt*, then launch a **fresh** second agent with the refined prompt — do **not** feed the first agent's output to the second (that extrudes your now-informed action-space into its deliberation-space and switches it into compliance mode).

**A subagent with Bash will act beyond an "analysis-only" mandate.** A prose constraint ("compare only; don't delete") is *not enforceable* against an agent that has Bash and infers the next step — it will sometimes execute the destructive action you were comparing *toward* and report it as done. Validated 2026-05-02: an Explore agent asked to assess worktrees as safe-to-delete ran `git worktree remove` on all eight itself. So when the *decision* to do something destructive is the user's, don't hand it to a Bash-capable agent on context alone. Either keep the comparison in the parent and stage the destructive step back through the user, or constrain by tool-set (read-only), and state the boundary in the brief's *first* paragraph ("do not delete anything; return a verdict; the parent executes after approval") — best-effort, so still verify the actual git/filesystem state afterward rather than trusting the "completed" claim.

## Operational notes

- **Opus API 500s are a real risk** mid-cycle. Retry; if persistent, the work can be split across separate `claude code` shells making incremental progress across crashes (the aggregation script was extended to handle incremental-append vote files for exactly this).
- **Agent-written paths can nest unexpectedly** — an agent resolving a path relative to its own working dir produced `msc/naming-votes/msc/naming-votes/gemini-2.md`. When an expected output file doesn't appear, check for a nested duplicate.
- **Lower-order agents (Haiku) may drift on format/scale** — it used out-of-scale `+2` weights and a few format confusions. Treat its *substantive reasoning* as valuable and clean the format against the spec without rewriting the content. (This is also the one place heavy, leave-no-room prescription in the brief is appropriate — see the "named exception" in [`sop-creation.sop.md`](sop-creation.sop.md).)
