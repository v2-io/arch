# Formulation: The Reality Model

The agent's compressed representation of how the world works, mapping interaction history to model space. This is a formulation choice — we commit to analyzing the agent as having a complete state $M_t$ that subsumes all retained information from its history.

## Formal Expression

*[Formulation (agent-model)]*

$$M_t = \phi(\mathcal{C}_t)$$

where:
- $\phi: \mathcal{C}^\ast \to \mathcal{M}$ maps interaction history to model space $\mathcal{M}$
- $\mathcal C_t = (o_1, a_1, \ldots, o_t)$ is the chronica ( #chronica) — the complete record of agent-environment interaction
- $\mathcal{M}$ is the space of possible models the agent can hold

The mapping $\phi$ is a many-to-one compression: multiple distinct histories may produce the same model state. This is not a deficiency — it is the essential function of the model: retaining what matters and discarding what does not.

## Epistemic Status

This is a *formulation* — a representational commitment, not a derived result. We choose to analyze agents as maintaining a state object $M_t$ that mediates between history and future action. Alternative formulations exist (e.g., history-based policies that map $\mathcal C_t$ directly to actions without an explicit model). The formulation is justified by its analytical utility: it enables the information bottleneck analysis ( #information-bottleneck), the mismatch decomposition ( #mismatch-signal), and the gain principle ( #update-gain).

## Discussion

**$M_t$ is the epistemic substate.** It captures "what the agent believes about reality." Different agents realize $M_t$ differently: a Kalman filter holds a state estimate and covariance matrix; an RL agent holds a value function; a developer holds a mental model of codebase architecture; an LLM agent holds its context window contents plus retrieved memory. The formalism is agnostic to the realization — it asks only that $M_t$ exist as a well-defined object that the agent's policy can condition on.

**Completeness assumption.** By writing $M_t = \phi(\mathcal C_t)$, we assume that $M_t$ captures everything the agent retains from its history. Any information not in $M_t$ is lost to the agent. This is what makes $M_t$ the complete epistemic substate, not merely one component of a richer internal representation. Whether $M_t$ retains *enough* information is the subject of #model-sufficiency.

**Degenerate cases.** A PID controller's $M_t$ is degenerate — it retains only the error signal and its history (integral, derivative), with no predictive capability beyond extrapolating recent trends. It occupies the "blind pursuer" region of the agent spectrum ( #agent-spectrum): its $O_t$ (setpoint) is clear but its $M_t$ is too impoverished to support the adaptive dynamics of Section I. The formalism accommodates this by allowing $\mathcal{M}$ to range from trivial (scalar) to rich (full world model).
